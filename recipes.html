<h3> Start Making!!</h3>

<ol>
<li> First wash the appels, thenl ay them on their sides. Remove the seeds by cutting a square around the seeds and pooping it out. And then cut them with cookie cutters, and make sure that the cutters are different sizes. Big, medium, and small. If you don't have cookie cutters, you can use a knife, I used a knife. It is easiest if you cut the appels a circle shape. Then stack the appels on top of each other, first big, then midium, and then small. </li>
<li> Next take a handfull of sunflower seeds, and stick them with the pointy part in the appels of the rim that is shown. If you do not understand you can go check the finished picture of it on the end of this recipe. </li> 
<li>In the squares you cut to remove the seeds, you can put spray millet in the gap. A birds favorite treat! Tip: if your bird does not like apple, you can sprinkle some spray millet on the cake. </li>
<li> Then Leave a little bit of space is the square hole for a strand of thyme. My bird's favorite leafy green! Put the hyme in the hole, and stick it there.</li>
<li> Lastly, you put your cake on the plate, and put some fresh cilantro around the cake and you can put some lettuce if you want to. </li>
</ol>
  <p> And then, let your bird enjoy!! Thanks for making it with me!! </p>
